I am Roberto, an Italian developer and technical independent consultant.
I started in 2003 as an ABAP developer in a big consulting firm, quickly moving towards consultancy and ultimately ended up independent in 2012, when I started collaborating directly with SAP on customer implementation projects.
I was in the journey since ERP 4.6B and went through the transformations, now riding the SAP Cloud Wagon.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Human Resources software implementation projects, focusing on systems integration using SAP tools
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...a lot! The move to the Cloud brought some incredibly interesting stuff!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I'll be able to help...I'll help ðŸ˜„
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: reach me on Twitter @st3v3b0b5 or drop me an email at robypag@me.com

Beside work, I am a music enthusiast - I even DJ sometimes - but most of my time is being spent with my beautiful little daughter!
